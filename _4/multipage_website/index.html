        <p class="about_wafaze text-justify">
          Warfaze is a Bangladeshi heavy metal band formed on 6 June 1984 in
          Dhaka by Meer, Helal, Naimul, Bappy, and Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal. They are
          considered to be one of the pioneering heavy metal band in Bangladesh.
          Multiple changes have taken place in membership after its founding
          since 1984. Since their inception, the band has released eight albums,
          including seven studio albums and one compilation album. In addition,
          they have released several singles in band mixed albums and one Lalon
          Tribute album. The band has experimented with different subgenres of
          hard rock and heavy metal over the years like Progressive Metal. The
          Band adapting the styles of Western rock and heavy metal sound led the
          band's establish a new flavor of Bangla music.</p>

          <strong>History</strong>
          <p class="about_wafaze text-justify">
          The first lineup of Warfaze in 1984 consisted Bappi on vocals, Mir and
          Naimul on guitars, Kamal on bass, Helal on drums. This initial line-up
          underwent the first of many changes with Helal, Mir, and Bappi having
          to leave the band for personal reasons. By that time Kamal met Tipu
          early 1986 and Tipu joined Warfaze as the drummer and co-founder. The
          band was far from breaking through to the mainstream music scene in
          Bangladesh. Heavy metal music was not much popular in Bangladesh back
          then.
        </p>
        <p class="about_wafaze text-justify">
          In 1986, Kamal took up lead guitar duties, Sheikh Monirul Alam Tipu as
          drummer, and Kamal and Tipu took Babna Karim as the bassist, and
          Reshad as the vocalist. This second line up had to be discontinued
          when Naimul emigrated to the US. At that time, there were three other
          Dhaka-based metal bands: Rockstrata, In Dhaka, and Aces. Mashuk Rahman
          from in Dhaka and Fuad from Aces volunteered to help Warfaze as guest
          members (guitarist) and Warfaze introduced Keyboard position in the
          band and Russell took the position. At the time, Warfaze was mostly a
          cover band, covering bands such as Deep Purple, Whitesnake, Dokken,
          Iron Maiden or Guns N' Roses.
        </p>
        <p class="about_wafaze text-justify">
          In 1988, Reshad had left the band for some personal reason and his
          place was filled by Sunjoy. Kamal had made arrangements for further
          education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former
          vocalist of Feedback, the band performed their own Bangla songs at a
          concert arranged by BAMBA at the University of Dhaka on 26 April 1992.
          The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it
          turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo
          album. The band went to release their self-titled album, Warfaze, on
          21 June 1991. The album featured the songs "Boshe Achi Eka" and "Ekti
          Chele". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to
          metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or
          patriotism were rare. It took several months for the album to gain
          popularity but later succeeded.
        </p>
        <p class="about_wafaze text-justify">
          The album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa
          Club. The next album, Obak Bhalobasha, was released by Sargam in 1994.
          Obak Bhalobasha featured songs with heavier sounds. Warfaze's sound
          got developed on this album. Obak Bhalobasha, the titled song from the
          album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures
          in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock
          songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim
          (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak
          Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung
          by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also one of the longest
          track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds.
          After completing Obak Bhalobasha Russel Ali left the band at this
          stage to start a music career in the United States later that year.
